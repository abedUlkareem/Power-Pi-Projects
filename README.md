# Power BI Projects - Data Analysis Using Power BI and DAX

This project involves applying data analysis techniques using Power BI and DAX on real-world datasets from Kickstarter and AdventureWorks 2022. The main tasks include:

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Importing raw datasets, handling missing values, and performing necessary transformations to ensure the data is ready for analysis.
Calculating Totals, Prices, and Metrics: Using DAX functions to compute key business metrics, such as total revenues, average prices, profit margins, and other financial indicators.
Creating Interactive Reports and Dashboards: Designing visually appealing and user-friendly Power BI reports and dashboards that allow stakeholders to interact with the data, filter by different dimensions, and drill down into detailed information.
Data Visualization: Leveraging advanced visualizations such as bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, and interactive slicers to present insights in an easily interpretable format.
Trend Analysis: Using Power BI's features to analyze trends over time, spot patterns, and provide actionable insights for decision-making.
Scenario Analysis: Building what-if scenarios to help in forecasting and decision-making based on different input variables.
Performance Tracking: Monitoring key performance indicators (KPIs) across various dimensions, such as project success rate, funding progress on Kickstarter, and sales performance in AdventureWorks.
